This repo contains a few programs that documents my learning journey
to develop a Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler to to solve regression problems. I will then compare my implementation
against the pymc3 library.

## Problems
- Linear regression (implemented)
- Non-linear regression
- Regression using a life-death transdimensional sampler.
