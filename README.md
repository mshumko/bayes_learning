This repo contains a few programs that documents my learning journey
to develop a Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler to to solve regression problems. I will then compare my implementation
against the pymc3 library.

## Problems Solved
- Linear regression from scratch
- Linear regression using pymc3

## Problems to Solve
- Non-linear regression from scratch
- Non-linear regression using pymc3
- Regression using a life-death transdimensional sampler
- Apply examples to real-life problems

## Linear Regression example
From running linear_regression.py
